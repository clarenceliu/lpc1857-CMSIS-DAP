The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1800 Board

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 4 BUTTONs (P4_0, P4_3, P4_4,WAKEUP)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  LPC1857_USB0 Flash:          configured for internal Flash
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1850_USB0 Ext. Flash:     configured for external Flash ROM
                               because of performance reasons, USB routines
                               are running from RAM,
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1857_USB1 Flash:          configured for internal Flash
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1850_USB1 Ext. Flash:     configured for external Flash ROM
                              (used for production or target debugging)
